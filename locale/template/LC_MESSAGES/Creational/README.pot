"In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns "
"that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a "
"manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation "
"could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. "
"Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling "
"this object creation."
